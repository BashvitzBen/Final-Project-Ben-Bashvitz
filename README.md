This repository contains my final project - a deep learning model for face recognition.
to use this project you must do the following things:
1. make sure you setup your preferred python environment.
2. download the following libraries: os,tensorflow,numpy,open cv, random, pickle.
3. download all of the files and folders in this repository into a single folder. i will refer to this folder as the main folder/.
4. extract all zipped folders in the FaceDetection/train directory. in this directory create two folder: Face and Not. place all images from the Face folders (Face 1-4)
   in the newly created Face folder and do the sa,e for the Not folders.
5. extract all zipped folders in the FaceRecognition/train directory and place them in a new folder called Not.
6. go to this google drive link and dowload the following files and folders from there straight into the main folder and unzip them there if necessary:
   FaceX.pickle, FaceY.pickle, ft_model. the link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16tJDZuT9XYcYUCAxfHe0t-plwiZkRB96?usp=sharing
once all of this is done you can run the project and follow the instructions from the console.
